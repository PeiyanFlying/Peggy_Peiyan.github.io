I am a final-year Ph.D. Student at Northeastern University, Boston, advised by [Prof. Yanzhi Wang](https://web.northeastern.edu/yanzhiwang/).

**<font color=red> I’m on academic job market this year, please reach out for any opportunities! </font>**

My research area is the intersection of Software-Hardware Co-design, Efficient AI, Hardware Architecture, SuperConducting Logic:

+ Hardware and Software Co-design for DNN Architecture
+ Inference-Efficient/Energy-Efficient Artificial Intelligence Systems
+ Efficient Deep Learning on Superconducting Devices
+ Emerging Deep Learning Systems

**Summary**: There are 16 first/co-first author publications ranging from:
(I) EDA, solid-state circuit, and system conferences such as DAC, ICCAD, ISSCC, ASP-DAC, RTAS, MLSys.
(II) Architecture and computer system conferences such as MICRO, HPCA, ICS.
(III) Machine learning algorithm conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, AAAI, ECCV, IJCAI, AAAI.
(IV) Journal publications including TCAD, Advanced Intelligent Systems, TCASI, TECS, TPAMI.
